Hi! 

A while ago I was struggling with my mental health, and I thought that maybe I'd feel better if I had noted down the highlight of the day and given it a rating. And it should serve as a good way to familiarize myself with Java, so here it is.

The app records your notes and ratings using a .json file "dayData.json" (it'll create one if none is existing). 

There are definitely room for improvement, such as highlighting the days that have rating/note on the calendar, but I'm gonna call it a day and push it up for now.
